# Just another encryption library

Hi there, I'm trying to create a program/library that lets me understand how encryption works.
I may plan to add an entire encrypted file format.

**⚠️⚠️DISCLAIMER⚠️⚠️: this library isn't meant to be used in any harmful way, so if it will be used in such a way, it's not my fault.**

ROADMAP:
- [x] Undestand how encryption works (*ish*)
- [x] Create a file/library that lets me encrypt messages ~with a key~
- [ ] Use the library/file to encrypt a file
- [ ] Create a file format that contains other files that are encrypted (ex.: encrypted zip-files)

Thanks for your attention.
